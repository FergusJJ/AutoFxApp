# AutoFxApp

## Description
An app I made to execute FIX messages via the CTrader API.
Messages are sent from a [separate API](https://github.com/FergusJJ/AutoFxApi).
This program will try to execute them.

> This was originally designed to be a paid application. If you want to use it you will need to clone the API and
> remove [WHOP](https://dev.whop.com/) authentication.

## Notes
- Note 1: Table element was meant to be switched to [this](https://github.com/Evertras/bubble-table) as I didn't add function to reformat the table on window size change.
- Note 2: In order to accurately display price, the (Ctrader OpenAPI)[https://openapi.ctrader.com/] is needed.
